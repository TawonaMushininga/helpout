# Impersonation

## Analytics Tool Integration

### General considerations

Before integrating a new Analitycs Tool, it's important to keep in mind that the impersonation feature can impact the metrics obtained.

Consider the actions that can be generated by a user who is impersonating, as the data may not accurately reflect real user activity. 
Examples of affected indicators could include clicks and visits.

### How it works

For the integration to works correctly, certain actions will be necessary:
- The cookie indicating that a user is being impersonated should be obtained from the session.
- If the cookie exists, a flag/attribute should be added to the Analytics Tool.
